# Image-Saturation-Calculator
Find the average saturation of any number of pixels in an image using a GUI in Python.

Yes, I know the GUI is awful, but it works probably.

### Area Mode:
Create an area by clicking once for each corner of a bounding rectangle.

### Pixel Mode:
Click a pixel to find its saturation.
