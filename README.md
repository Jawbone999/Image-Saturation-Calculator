# Image-Saturation-Calculator
Find the average saturation of any number of pixels in an image using command line Python.

Put your images in the `samples` folder and run the program from the folder `saturation.py` is in. It will iterate through each image, asking you to input space-separated coordinates for pixels, and print the average saturation in that area as a percentage.
